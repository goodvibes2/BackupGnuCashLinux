    Note: Java 1.8.0_72 or later is now required due to bug 
        https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8136838
        which meant the value of ComboBox.getValue() was not correct in previous
        versions.
        As of 15 Jul 2016, the current Java version on Windows is 1.8.0_92 and
        on Ubuntu 16.04 is 1.8.0_91.
        Ubuntu 16.04 openjfx is version 8u60-b27-4 which works so long as when 
        adding a new book, ENTER is pressed after typing a new book name into
        the Book combobox. I.e. Press ENTER before leaving the combobox.
